    <description><![CDATA[
    Implementation of two first rules of android's security guidelines, a extension of the work done on the SPECK project.

    SPECK is a tool designed to search for several bad coding pratices on an Android application, either in source code or packaged APKs. From the android documentation, we extracted a set of rules to follow, in order to preserve apps' security. It performs a static analysis by looking through the source code of an app, in order to detect rules' violations.
